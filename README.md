# d9hook Concept 

Internal hack for any game using DirectX9 and imgui to render a menu. It hook functions and steal the game's d3d device to render things like the menu and other stuff. It still only a concept and can be improved !<br/>
I didn't spent a lot of time on it<br/>

You will need to use the detour lib: `https://github.com/Nukem9/detours`.<br/>
Make sure to included it in Visual Studio and build the detour lib
